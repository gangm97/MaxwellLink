- **calculate_lr_tddft.py**: A sample Python script to calculate linear-response TDDFT excited states of a given molecule using the Psi4 Python API.

- **plot_rt_spectra_pade.py**: A sample Python script to plot electronic excited-state transitions using real-time TDDFT vs linear-response TDDFT, where the real-time dipole info is stored in **rt_tddft_energy_dipoles.txt**, and the linear-response TDDFT states are stored in excitations_LR.txt.
