Documentation
======================================

MaxwellLink couples finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetics with
quantum and molecular dynamics packages through a lightweight socket interface.
Use these docs to install the toolkit, build your first coupled simulation, and
explore the available molecular drivers.
